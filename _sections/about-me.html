<p>
Hello! My name is Brendan, a newly minted PhD from the <a href="https://cmdb.jhu.edu/">Cellular, Molecular, Developmental Biology and Biophysics Department</a> at Johns Hopkins University. I also was part of a <a href="https://www.training.nih.gov/programs/gpp/partner/jhu/">Graduate Partnership Program</a> between the National Institutes of Health and JHU. I completed my thesis under the guidance of <a href="https://www.genome.gov/staff/Laura-Elnitski-PhD">Dr. Laura Elnitski</a> in the National Human Genome Research Institute.
<br /><br />
During my PhD I developed cancer detection assays based on patterns of DNA methylation in circulating cell-free DNA from blood plasma samples (aka liquid biopsies). I'm excited to integrate my foundational training as a wet lab biologist with computational strategies to help solve fundamental problems in health and disease!
